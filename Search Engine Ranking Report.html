<h1>Search Engine Ranking Report</h1>

<p>1. How does a search engine work?</p>
<p>Search engine usually include three primary functions. First of all, the Crawl is the internet for content and looking over the code/content for each URL 
  they find. Secondly, the Index also can store and organize the content found during the crawling process. If a page is in the index, itâ€™s in the running to be 
  displayed as a result to relevant queries. The third one is the Rank which provide the pieces of content that will best answer a searcher's query which means that results are 
  ordered by most relevant to least relevant.</p>

<p>2. Why do different search-engines give different ranking to websites for the same search phrase? </p>
<p>Search engines can produce different results because bots crawl and have different web representations. In this case, search engine-specific algorithms have different rankings for keywords,
  so the same search is displayed differently.</p>

<p>3. What is a <meta> tag? What is the purpose for Keyword and Description meta tags?</p>
<p>A <meta> tag is a piece of text that describes the content of the page; the <meta> tag is not displayed on the page itself, but only in the source code of the page. The Meta elements are 
  typically used to specify page descriptions, keywords, authors of documents, last modified, and other metadata.</p>

<p>4. Why might you include meta tags in your pages? Do meta tags make your pages more easily searchable or improve its ranking?</p>
<p>The <meta> tag is an important part because it can be used for search engines to index web pages based on title, description, and even keywords. In addition, the meta tags can make pages more 
  easily searchable because meta tags can potentially help your SEO rankings.</p>

<p>5. What are several ways that you can publicize your personal website project and make it more visible on the web?</p>
<p>First of all, optimize every page of site. Secondly, optimize images. Thirdly, Make content easily for shareable.</p>
